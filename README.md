Oops! Something went wrong! :(

ESLint: 8.14.0

ESLint couldn't find the plugin "@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin".

(The package "@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin" was not found when loaded as a Node module from the directory "yarn-berry-issue".)

It's likely that the plugin isn't installed correctly. Try reinstalling by running the following:

    npm install @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin@latest --save-dev

The plugin "@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin" was referenced from the config file in ".eslintrc.json » @lifeomic/eslint-config-standards » ./typescript#overrides[0]".

If you still can't figure out the problem, please stop by https://eslint.org/chat/help to chat with the team.
